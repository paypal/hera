Python Hera Client
==================

If I have done my work correctly here, this code is a client for Hera open source version that will work with
both Python2 and Python3.

The test file (test/test_open_hera.py) illustrates how to use it.  It has only been tested with MySQL engine.

The ns_help directory contains a dependency (not in PyPi) so first python setup.py install --user in that directory.
