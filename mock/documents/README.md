## Introduction
[HERA](https://github.com/paypal/hera#readme) (High Efficiency Reliable Access to data stores, Open sourced as HERA by PayPal) is a key enabler for scaling and
improving availability of relational (Oracle/MySQL/Postgres) databases at PayPal.

*heramock* (otherwise called**heramock**) is an altus custom docker app which helps to mock all the database
operation handled via HERA.

### Target Audience

    I want to isolate my application's functional test from all database operations(hera based MySQL/Oracle).
    I want to see every data passed between my application and database (say for debugging)
    I want to simulate negative cases related to database such as query timeout, transaction failure, commit failure ...
    I want to do load & performance testing on my application and avoid database related operations skewing my report?

### What are we mocking here

1. All database operations done via OCC.

2. What are the database operations my application does?

    1. Select/Update/Insert/PLSQL
    2. Database Transactions
    3. Commit/Rollback

## Basics

1. **heramock** sits between application and OCC.
2. Ports Exposed
    1. It listens to all the ports that are mocked
        1. Example: 10101
    2. Also, it listens to one control port **13916** where it exposes various API for developers to use
3. **heramock** can be deployed in linux/windows/mac/testenv in QA/Dev environments
4. Mocking is done on request basis in our case request is select/update/insert etc ..
5. Mocking instruction has to be sent to **heramock** through api exposed on its control port (13916)
6. Without any specific instruction **heramock** act as pass through layer, logging all the request/response through it.
7. Default backend for **heramock** is msmaster.
    1. So in our example just deploying **heramock** by mocking 10101
    2. Will act as proxy and logging all the communication between app and hera
8. heramockHelper is a java class exposed by heramockclient JAR. This will help developers to talk to apis exposed by **heramock** in control port.
9. Mock works on key value pair.
    1. Key is the identifier of the request.
        1. In case of SQL it will be SQL comment.
        2. In case of flow it will be corrid.
        3. Sometimes there are special keys more than one keys separated by ":".
    2. Value is the mock response the code is expecting. This response needs to be in specific format.

| SSL Failure during connect                | We could simulate SSL failure using this method. <br/> <br/>Internally it calls add mock as addMock(heramockAction.ACCEPT, heramockAction.SIMULATE_AUTH_FAILURE, 1);<br/> <br/> it is also available in port level. Meaning we could target only one hera.                                                                                                                               | `boolean simulateCustomAuthConnectionFailure()`. Note these are connection level mock if we start the app and set this only new connections will get affected, old connection in connection pool cache are already in connected state. <br/> <br/>We could use heramock reload option to kill the existing connection, to simulate new connect failure with SSL <br/> <br/> `boolean simulateCustomAuthConnectionFailure(String port)` |
| Connection Timeout                        | We could simulate connection timeout same as SSL failure, <br/> <br/>these are applicable only for new connection and we can do port level connection timeout too. Internally it calls addMock(heramockAction.ACCEPT, heramockAction.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, 1);                                                                                                                             | `boolean simulateConnectionTimeout()` && `boolean simulateConnectionTimeout(int timeout)` && `boolean simulateConnectionTimeout(String port)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Clock Skew                                | We could simulate clock skew. Both general and port level mock is available. <br/> <br/> Internally it calls addMock(heramockAction.ACCEPT + ":" + port, heramockAction.SIMULATE_CLOCK_SKEW, 1);                                                                                                                                                                                         | `boolean simulateConnectionClockSkew()` && `boolean simulateConnectionClockSkew(String port)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Connection Level Mock                     | SSL Failure, Connect Timeout, Clock Skew are all called as connection level mock and to remove the mock we need remove mock.  <br/> <br/>Internally it calls removeMock removeMock(heramockAction.ACCEPT + ':' + mockKey);                                                                                                                                                               | `boolean removeConnectionMock()` && `boolean removeConnectionMock(String mockKey)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Request & Response Capture                | We could capture request and response for specific query or set of queries under same correlation id. <br/> <br/> We need two calls here one to start capture and another to end. Underlying it is simple add Mock - addMock(key, heramockAction.CAPTURE);                                                                                                                               | `boolean startRRCapture(String key)` && `void endRRCapture(String key, String outFile)` // since response are too huge we get output file name and write the response there instead of returning it  <br/> <br/> SQL capture - `JSONObject getCapturedSQLResponse(String key, Object[] objects)` && `Map<String, String> getCapturedSQLResponse(String key)`                                                                          |
| Replay captured response                  | We could use the captured response and play for same query again or same flow with new corrid. <br/> <br/> We can also get status of replay if it has completed correctly. In case of success we get "success" as response and failure time we get details on failure sql                                                                                                                | `boolean replayCaptured(String key, String fileName)` && `boolean replayCaptured(String key, String fileName, int timeout)`  <br/> <br/> `String getReplayStatus(String key)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Add Mock                                  | Simple Add mock as many over loaded methods. Add Mock can have simple String as value or any POJO/Entity Object to respond                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `boolean addMockForEver(String key, String/Object value)` // mock does not expire<br/> <br/> `boolean addMock(String key, String value/Object)` // simple add Mock expires in 100 sec <br/> <br/> `boolean addMock(String key, String value/Object, int nThOccurance)` // if there are more time query with key (query comment) comes the mock nThOccurance (default is 1). -1 is forever, 2 is for second, -3 is for first three     |

## Setup and Integration

### How to start and stop **heramock** in laptop/desktop

#### Basic Steps
1. Start **heramock** in laptop with hera's which needed to be mocked as parameter
2. Run the test case to see the queries in mock/logs
3. Run the app and hit the endpoint or use FT to see all the queries passed through mock
