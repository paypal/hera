## How can you help

### Code
Look for Issues that are open on below categories, pick an issue, start a slack discussion on slack channel, once we get to common grounds on the solution approach, open a PR with your implementation.
* Bug Fixes
* Enhancements & Improvements (Jira Details)
* Add a new connector or major feature that you see missing in Gimel

### Documentation
You can also improve our documentation
* readme.md
* docs/*.md
* Any other valuable comment you'd like to add to the code that will simplify other developers' lives.

## Contribution Process

* Get your github account.
* Fork the gimel repo into your account.
* Create an issue branch using the master branch.
* Make modifications to the code.
* Ensure code coverage by added test cases.
* All commits must have the issue ID & summary. Say "[ISSUE-10] Update readme.md for MySQL".
* Ensure all your commits are squashed.
* Make a Pull Request to dev branch.
* If there are code review related changes - ensure those commits are also squashed.
* DO NOT include changes that are not directly related to the issue you are trying to resolve.
* Once PR is approved, code will be merged to Development branch.
* Once all regression test cases have passed - changes will be merged to master branch.
